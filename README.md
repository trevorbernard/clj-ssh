# clj-ssh

SSH in clojure.  Uses jsch.

## Usage

### REPL

The `clj-ssh.cli` namespace provides some functions for ease of use at the REPL.

```clj
(use 'clj-ssh.cli)
```

Use `ssh` to execute a command, say `ls`, on a remote host "my-host",

```clj
(ssh "my-host" "ls")
  => {:exit 0 :out "file1\nfile2\n" :err "")
```

By default this will use the system ssh-agent to obtain your ssh keys, and it
uses your current username, but this can be specified:

```clj
(ssh "my-host" "ls" :username "remote-user")
  => {:exit 0 :out "file1\nfile2\n" :err "")
```

Strict host key checking can be turned off:

```clj
(default-session-options {:strict-host-key-checking :no})
```

SFTP is also supported. For example, to copy a local file to a remote host
"my-host":

```clj
(sftp "my-host" :put "/from/this/path" "to/this/path")
```

Note that any sftp commands that change the state of the sftp session (such as
cd) do not work with the simplified interface, as a new session is created each
time.

If your key has a passphrase, you will need to explicitly add your key either to
the system's ssh-agent, or to clj-ssh's ssh-agent with the appropriate
`add-identity` call.

### Non REPL

The `clj-ssh.ssh` namespace should be using SSH from functional code.

```clj
(let [agent (ssh-agent {:use-system-ssh-agent false})]
  (add-identity agent "/user/name/.ssh/id_rsa")
  (let [session (session agent "localhost" {:strict-host-key-checking :no})]
    (with-connection session
      (let [result (ssh session {:in "echo hello"})]
        (println (result :out)))
      (let [result (ssh session {:cmd "ls"}]
        (println (second result))))))
```

The above example shows using `:in` to pass commands to a shell, and using
`:cmd` to exec a command without a shell. When using `:cmd` you can still pass
a stream or a string to `:in` to be used as the process' standard input.

```clj
(let [agent (ssh-agent {})]
  (let [session (session agent "localhost" {:strict-host-key-checking :no})]
    (with-connection session
      (let [channel (ssh-sftp session)]
        (with-channel-connection channel
          (sftp channel {} :cd "/remote/path")
          (sftp channel {} :put "/some/file" "filename"))))))
```

SSH tunneling is also supported:

```clj
    (let [agent (ssh-agent {:use-system-ssh-agent false})]
      (let [session (session agent "localhost" :strict-host-key-checking :no)]
        (with-connection session
          (with-local-port-forward [session 8080 80]
            (comment do something with port 8080 here)))))
```

## FAQ

Q: What does
"4: Failure @ com.jcraft.jsch.ChannelSftp.throwStatusError(ChannelSftp.java:2289)"
during an sftp transfer signify?

A: Probably a disk full, or permission error.
